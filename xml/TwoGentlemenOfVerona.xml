            <l> Love bade me swear , and love bids me forswear . </l>
            <l> O sweet-suggesting Love , if thou hast sinned , </l>

            <l> At first I did adore a twinkling star , </l>

            <l> For love is still most precious in itself , </l>
            <l> And Sylvia — witness heaven that made her fair — </l>

            <l> But Valentine being gone , I’ll quickly cross </l>

            <l> When a man’s servant shall play the cur with </l>
            <l> him , look you , it goes hard — one that I brought up </l>
            <l> of a puppy , one that I saved from drowning when </l>
            <l> three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went </l>
            <l> to it . I have taught him even as one would say </l>
            <l> precisely “ Thus I would teach a dog . ” I was sent to </l>
            <l> deliver him as a present to Mistress Sylvia from my </l>
            <l> master ; and I came no sooner into the dining </l>
            <l> chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals </l>
            <l> her capon’s leg . O , ’tis a foul thing when a cur </l>
            <l> cannot keep himself in all companies ! I would have , </l>
            <l> as one should say , one that takes upon him to be a </l>
            <l> dog indeed ; to be , as it were , a dog at all things . If I </l>
            <l> had not had more wit than he , to take a fault upon </l>
            <l> me that he did , I think verily he had been hanged </l>
            <l> for ’t . Sure as I live , he had suffered for ’t . You shall </l>
            <l> judge . He thrusts me himself into the company of </l>
            <l> three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the Duke’s </l>
            <l> table ; he had not been there — bless the mark ! — a </l>
            <l> pissing while but all the chamber smelt him . “ Out </l>
            <l> with the dog ! ” says one . “ What cur is that ? ” says </l>
            <l> another . “ Whip him out ! ” says the third . “ Hang him </l>
            <l> up ! ” says the Duke . I , having been acquainted with </l>
            <l> the smell before , knew it was Crab , and goes me to </l>
            <l> the fellow that whips the dogs . “ Friend , ” quoth I , </l>
            <l> “ You mean to whip the dog ? ” “ Ay , marry , do I , ” </l>
            <l> quoth he . “ You do him the more wrong , ” quoth I . </l>
            <l> “ ’Twas I did the thing you wot of . ” He makes me no </l>
            <l> more ado but whips me out of the chamber . How </l>
            <l> many masters would do this for his servant ? Nay , </l>
            <l> I’ll be sworn I have sat in the stocks for puddings he </l>
            <l> hath stolen ; otherwise he had been executed . I have </l>
            <l> stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed ; otherwise </l>
