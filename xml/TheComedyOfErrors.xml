            <l> ’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , </l>
            <l> It hath in solemn synods been decreed , </l>

            <l> A heavier task could not have been imposed </l>
            <l> Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable ; </l>
            <l> Yet , that the world may witness that my end </l>
            <l> Was wrought by nature , not by vile offense , </l>
            <l> I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave . </l>
            <l> In Syracusa was I born , and wed </l>
            <l> Unto a woman happy but for me , </l>
            <l> And by me , had not our hap been bad . </l>
            <l> With her I lived in joy . Our wealth increased </l>
            <l> By prosperous voyages I often made </l>
            <l> To Epidamium , till my factor’s death </l>
            <l> And the great care of goods at random left </l>
            <l> Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse ; </l>
            <l> From whom my absence was not six months old </l>
            <l> Before herself — almost at fainting under </l>
            <l> The pleasing punishment that women bear — </l>
            <l> Had made provision for her following me </l>
            <l> And soon and safe arrivèd where I was . </l>
            <l> There had she not been long but she became </l>
            <l> A joyful mother of two goodly sons , </l>
            <l> And , which was strange , the one so like the other </l>
            <l> As could not be distinguished but by names . </l>
            <l> That very hour , and in the selfsame inn , </l>
            <l> A mean woman was deliverèd </l>
            <l> Of such a burden , male twins , both alike . </l>
            <l> Those , for their parents were exceeding poor , </l>
            <l> I bought and brought up to attend my sons . </l>
            <l> My wife , not meanly proud of two such boys , </l>
            <l> Made daily motions for our home return . </l>
            <l> Unwilling , I agreed . Alas , too soon </l>
            <l  > We came aboard . </l>
            <l> A league from Epidamium had we sailed </l>
            <l> Before the always-wind-obeying deep </l>
            <l> Gave any tragic instance of our harm ; </l>
            <l> But longer did we not retain much hope , </l>
            <l> For what obscurèd light the heavens did grant </l>
            <l> Did but convey unto our fearful minds </l>
            <l> A doubtful warrant of immediate death , </l>
            <l> Which though myself would gladly have embraced , </l>
            <l> Yet the incessant weepings of my wife , </l>
            <l> Weeping before for what she saw must come , </l>
            <l> And piteous plainings of the pretty babes , </l>
            <l> That mourned for fashion , ignorant what to fear , </l>
            <l> Forced me to seek delays for them and me . </l>
            <l> And this it was , for other means was none : </l>
            <l> The sailors sought for safety by our boat </l>
            <l> And left the ship , then sinking-ripe , to us . </l>
            <l> My wife , more careful for the latter-born , </l>
            <l> Had fastened him unto a small spare mast , </l>
            <l> Such as seafaring men provide for storms . </l>
            <l> To him one of the other twins was bound , </l>
            <l> Whilst I had been like heedful of the other . </l>
            <l> The children thus disposed , my wife and I , </l>
            <l> Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed , </l>
            <l> Fastened ourselves at either end the mast </l>
            <l> And , floating straight , obedient to the stream , </l>
            <l> Was carried towards Corinth , as we thought . </l>
            <l> At length the sun , gazing upon the earth , </l>
            <l> Dispersed those vapors that offended us , </l>
            <l> And by the benefit of his wished light </l>
            <l> The seas waxed calm , and we discoverèd </l>
            <l> Two ships from far , making amain to us , </l>
            <l> Of Corinth that , of Epidaurus this . </l>
            <l> But ere they came — O , let me say no more ! </l>
            <l> Gather the sequel by that went before . </l>
